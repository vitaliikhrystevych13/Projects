# Projects
Hi, my name is Vitalii, I am Data Analyst and in repository you can find my analytical and machine learning projects. Here I store projects on Ukrainian, English and Russian languages.  
These projects were done during my studies. As well here will be listed all other interesting projects for your review.

| Project name | Project description | Used libraries and skills  | Project language |
| :---------------------- | :---------------------- | :---------------------- | :---------------------- |
| [User Behavior Research Project](User_Behavior_Research_Project) | In this project I researched behaviour of the product application users, determined the way and amount of theirs "journey" in the application, constructed product funnels and found out how the change of the font influenced on the users using A/A and A/B testing methods | *pandas, plotly, numpy, stats, cmath, datetime, A / B testing* | russian
| [Online Store project](Research_project_for_increasing_revenue_in_an_online_store_with_AB_testing) |  In this project, I prioritized hypotheses for ICE and RICE frameworks. Then analyzed A / B tests results, plotted graphs of cumulative revenue, cumulative average bill, cumulative conversions by groups, and then calculated the statistical significance of the differences conversions, the average bill for raw and cleaned data | *pandas, matplotlib, sciPy, A / B testing, statistical hypothesis testing* | russian
| [Marketing costs optimization project](Marketing_costs_optimization_in_the_web_service_project) | I did an analysis of data from the web service which sells tickets to the events (concerts, plays, etc.) was carried out in order to optimize marketing costs. During the project, it was calculated such metrics as LTV, CAC, Retention rate, DAU, WAU, MAU, ROMI. | *pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, numpy, cohort analysis, unit economics, product metrics* | russian
| [Catering establishments research](Research_on_catering_establishments_in_Moscow) | I investigated the question - will the cafe be successful and popular for a long time, where guests are served by robotic waiters. Based on the analysis results, a presentation for investors with recommendations. For visualization, I used libraries seaborn and plotly | *pandas, seaborn, plotly* | russian
| [Tableau dashboard for online platform](Dashboard_for_online_platform) | Here I connected to the remote server, uploaded dataset with SQL query and based on the uploaded dataset, designed dashboard of user interaction on online platform in Tableau | *pandas, SQL, Tableau* | russian  
| [Churn prediction model and clients clusterization for the gym-chain](Forecasting_model_and_customer_clustering) | Goals of this project are to predict the likelihood of churn (at the next month's level) for each client, form typical portraits of clients and analyze the main features that most strongly affect the outflow using machine learning instruments for gym-chain | *Python, numpy, seaborn, sklearn, K-means, RandomForestClassifier, LogisticRegression, accuracy score, precision score, recall score, roc_auc_score, cluster dendrogram* | russian
